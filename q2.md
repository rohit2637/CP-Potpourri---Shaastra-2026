### Problem Description

A row measuring **N** units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of **M** units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.

A valid arrangement is any way to place red blocks and black squares such that:
* Every red block has length at least **M**.
* No two red blocks touch — there is at least one black square between them.
* Everything fits exactly into the row of length **N**.

For example, there are exactly seventeen ways of doing this for **M = 3** and **N = 7**.

**NOTE:** Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility, in general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example, on a row measuring eight units in length (and **M=3**) you could use red(3), black(1), and red(4).

### Matrix Exponentiation

For larger values of **n**, we use matrix exponentiation, as the recurrence relation depends only on a fixed number of previous states. This allows us to compute the answer in logarithmic time.
### Fibonacci Sequence and Matrix Exponentiation

Consider the **Fibonacci sequence**, where **F<sub>i</sub> = F<sub>i-1</sub> + F<sub>i-2</sub>**, **i > 2**.

We create a state vector **V<sub>i</sub> = [F<sub>i-2</sub>, F<sub>i-1</sub>]**.

**V<sub>i+1</sub> = T × V<sub>i</sub>**, where **T** is the transition matrix. 
We raise this matrix to the required power and multiply with the initial state **V<sub>3</sub> = [0, 1]** to get the state vector corresponding to **V<sub>n+1</sub>**. Using this, find the value of **F<sub>n</sub>**.

### Task

Given **N** and **M**, determine how many valid arrangements exist. Because the answer can be extremely large, report it modulo **10<sup>9</sup> + 7**.

### Input Format
The input contains two space-separated integers **N** and **M**.

### Constraints
* 1 < **N** < 10<sup>18</sup>
* 1 < **M** < 50

### Output Format
Print one integer — the answer to the problem modulo **10<sup>9</sup> + 7**.
