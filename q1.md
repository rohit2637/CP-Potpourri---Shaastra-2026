You have discovered **n** mysterious charges placed on a line, each having an integer charge **c<sub>1</sub>**, **c<sub>2</sub>**, …, **c<sub>n</sub>**.

You possess a special device that allows you to perform the following operation:

### Operation
- Choose one particle and remove it from the line.
- The remaining particles shift to fill the gap.
- If the removed particle had **two neighboring particles** with charges `x` (left) and `y` (right), they **merge into a single particle** with charge `x + y`.

### Example

If the particles are: [-3, 1, 4, -1, 5, -9]

Removing the 4th particle (`-1`) results in: [-3, 1, 9, -9]

If we then remove the 1st particle in the new line, we get: [1, 9, -9]

### Task

You will repeatedly apply the operation until **only one particle remains**.

Determine the **maximum possible charge** of the final remaining particle.

### Input
The first line contains an integer **t** — the number of test cases. 1 ≤ **t** ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>.

For each test case:
* The first line contains an integer **n** — the number of particles. 1 ≤ **n** ≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>.
* The second line contains **n** integers **c<sub>1</sub>**, **c<sub>2</sub>**, …, **c<sub>n</sub>**, -10<sup>9</sup> ≤ **c<sub>i</sub>** ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>.

It is guaranteed that the sum of **n** over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>.

---

### Output
For each test case, output one integer — the maximum charge of the remaining particle.
