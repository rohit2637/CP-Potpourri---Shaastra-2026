## **Problem Statement**

You are given a sequence of **n** integers **a1, a2, ..., an**

Determine whether there exists a sequence of **n** integers **b1, b2, ..., bn** such that the following condition holds:

For **each i** (1 ≤ i ≤ n), there exist two (not necessarily distinct) indices **j** and **k** (1 ≤ j, k ≤ n) such that: **ai = bj - bk**

---

## **Input**

- The first line contains a single integer **t** (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains one integer **n** (1 ≤ n ≤ 10).
  - The second line contains **n** integers  
    **a1, a2, ..., an**  
    where **-100000 ≤ ai ≤ 100000**.

---

## **Output**

For each test case, output:

- **YES** — if there exists a sequence **b1, b2, ..., bn** satisfying the condition.
- **NO** — otherwise.
