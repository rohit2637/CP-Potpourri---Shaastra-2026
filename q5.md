### Problem Description

On the front panel of an ancient calculator there are: a **red button**, a **blue button**, and a **display** showing some positive integer. 

* **Red Button:** Multiplies the displayed number by two (**×2**).
* **Blue Button:** Subtracts one from the number on the display (**-1**).

If at some point the number stops being positive (becomes 0 or less), the calculator breaks down. The display can show arbitrarily large numbers. Initially, the display shows the number **n**.

Bob wants to get the number **m** on the display. What is the **minimum number of clicks** he has to make in order to achieve this result?

### Input
The first and the only line of the input contains two distinct integers **n** and **m** (1 ≤ **n**, **m** ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>), separated by a space.

### Output
Print a single number — the minimum number of times one needs to push the button required to get the number **m** out of number **n**.
