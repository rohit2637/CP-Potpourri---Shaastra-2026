## Problem

**In this question, you are required to debug the given code.**

You are given an array `a` of size `n`.

There is an `n × n` grid. In the `i`-th row, the first `ai` cells are black and the remaining cells are white.

In other words, for the cell `(i, j)`:

- cells `(i, 1), (i, 2), ..., (i, ai)` are black  
- cells `(i, ai + 1), (i, ai + 2), ..., (i, n)` are white  

You can perform the following operations any number of times and in any order:

1. **Dye a 2 × 2 subgrid white.**  
2. **Dye an entire row white.**  

**Note:** You are **NOT** allowed to dye an entire column white.

Your task is to find the **minimum number of operations** required to dye all cells in the grid white.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `t` — the number of test cases.  
  `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`

- For each test case:  
  - The first line contains an integer `n` — the size of the array `a`.  
    `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5`  
  - The second line contains `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an`  
    `0 ≤ ai ≤ n`

**It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**

---

### Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the **minimum number of operations** required to dye all cells white.
